# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python and Pandas to uncover statistical insights and data patterns.
👋 About The Project
This project represents a key step in my journey to master Data Science and Python. While working with the Mobiles Dataset, I focused on understanding the core concepts of data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical reasoning using the Pandas library.

The goal of this project was not just to analyze numbers, but to practice "thinking like a data scientist"—cleaning raw data, extracting insights, and writing efficient, readable code.

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:

Data Wrangling: Loading and handling datasets with different encodings (e.g., ISO-8859-1).

Advanced Indexing: Mastering the difference between label-based (loc) and position-based (iloc) indexing.

Statistical Analysis: Computing descriptive statistics (mean, std dev, quartiles) to summarize large datasets.

Data Filtering & Querying: Writing complex conditional logic to isolate specific time periods (2015-2020 market analysis).

Data Integrity: Detecting and quantifying missing values (null data) to ensure analysis accuracy.

🛠️ Tech Stack
